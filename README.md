How to choose your major?
Project Description:
How to choose your major (Major dilemma) is a short video about the stress students have to go
through when deciding what major to choose (in a comedic way). The idea is to in some kind of way advertise
or just show off the project by making a fun eye catching website with the video being the focus of attention.

Process:
To implement the concept, we first shot the video at the NYUAD Campus and edited it using the program
CapCut. After that, we visualised the website on which we wanted to feature the movie by making wireframes
using various applications (I used Adobe Photoshop CC). When we had the wireframes ready, it was all down 
to coding out the website by using html, styilng it with css and making it interactive with JavaScript.
I used Visual Studio Code to implement the code. Finally, the finished webpage was uploaded to GitHub.

Reflections:
To reflect, I think this project was definately succesfull. I even went over my expectations and goals
by making the website more interactive and also more colorful than what I planned. All in all the
making of the project went smoothly with the help of the materials we recieved from the professor and the
classes we had on Zoom.
